   <h1>How COVID-19 Spreads</h1>
    <p>COVID-19 is thought to spread mainly through close contact from person-to-person. Some people without symptoms
      may be able to spread the virus. We are still learning about how the virus spreads and the severity of illness it causes.</p>
    <h2>Person-to-person spread</h2>
    <ul>The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.
     <li>Between people who are in close contact with one another (within about 6 feet).</li>
     <li>Through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks.</li>
     <li>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</li>
     <li>COVID-19 may be spread by people who are not showing symptoms.</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h2>
    <ul>Symptoms of COVID-19 include:
     <li>A new, continuous cough, where you cough a lot for more than an hour, or have three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours </li>
     <li>Fever - where your temperature is above 37.8C </li>
     <li>Loss of smell or taste </li>
     <li> Fatigue</li>
     <li>Chills, sometimes with shaking </li>
     <li>Body aches </li>
     <li> Sore throat</li>
     <li>Nausea </li>
     <li>Diarrhea </li>

   </ul>
   <h2>How do I know if it’s COVID-19  or the flu? </h2>
   <ul>
     <li>You have a fever and a cough.</li>
     <li>You live in an area with the virus or have traveled to places where it has spread.</li>
   </ul>

     <h2 >Causes of the New Coronavirus</h2>

     <p >Researchers aren’t sure what caused it. There’s more than one type of coronavirus. They’re common in people and in
      animals including bats, camels, cats, and cattle. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is similar to MERS and
       SARS. They all came from bats. </p>
     <h2>How contagious is the coronavirus?</h2>
      <p>The transmission rate is relatively high. Early research has estimated that one person who has it can spread it to
        between 2 and 2.5 others. One study found that the rate was higher, with one case spreading to between 4.7 and 6.6
        other people. By comparison, one person who has the seasonal flu will pass it to between 1.1 and 2.3 others.

        We can work to lower the transmission rate by washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, limiting contact with other
        people, and wearing cloth face masks when we can’t stay 6 feet away from others.</p>
        <h2>Can coronavirus be transmitted through groceries, packages, or food?</h2>
        <p>You’re much more likely to get COVID-19 from another person than from packages, groceries, or food. If you’re in a high-risk
          group, stay home and use a delivery service or have a friend shop for you. Have them leave the items outside your front door,
          if you can. If you do your own shopping, try to stay at least 6 feet away from other shoppers. That isn’t always possible, so
          wear a cloth face mask, too.

          Wash your hands for at least 20 seconds before and after bringing things into your home. The coronavirus can linger on hard
          surfaces, so clean and disinfect countertops and anything else your bags have touched. You can wipe down plastic, metal, or
          glass packaging with soap and water if you want.

          There’s no evidence that anyone has gotten COVID-19 from food or food containers.</p>
